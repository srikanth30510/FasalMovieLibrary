## Introduction

Fasal Movie Library WebApp is a web application designed to allow users to search for movies, view details about them, and create playlists of their favorite movies. It utilizes various technologies such as NodeJS, ExpressJS, MongoDB, and OMDB API to provide a seamless movie browsing experience.

## Technologies Used

1. **Javascript**: The primary programming language used for both frontend and backend development.
2. **NodeJS and ExpressJS**: For building the server-side application and handling HTTP requests.
3. **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database used for storing user information, movie details, and playlists.
4. **PassportJS**: A library used for authentication, ensuring secure user sign-in and sign-up functionalities.
5. **OMDB API**: An external Movie Library API used to fetch detailed information about movies.
6. **HTML, CSS, ejs**: For frontend development, providing the user interface and styling.

## Features

1. **Authentication**: Users can sign in and sign up securely using PassportJS.
2. **MVC Architecture**: The application follows the Model-View-Controller architecture for better organization and maintainability.
3. **Movie Search**: Users can search for movies by name and retrieve detailed information about them.
4. **Playlist Management**: Users can create playlists of their favorite movies and add/remove movies from them.
5. **Privacy Settings**: Playlists are private by default, ensuring that only the user can view them after logging in.
6. **Public Playlist Sharing**: Users can share the public playlists using a sharable link, allowing others to access and view them.
7. **Public Access**: Shared playlists can be accessed publicly by anyone with the provided link.
